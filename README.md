Hi! I'm Erika . This page records my progress in Data Science &amp; NLP.

# About This Project
### 🐍 Learning Python (Properly This Time)
Back in the day, I actually played around with Python not for school, but for fun. 
I used to build a little script that could automatically bid on healing potions in Neopets (yes, that browser game from the 2000s). 
It was completely out of curiosity no structure, no formal training, just me figuring things out step by step.

This repo is my attempt to finally learn Python the right way documenting my progress, building small projects, and hopefully showing how far I’ve come since that first messy potion-sniping bot.

### 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- Notes and mini-projects from my ongoing Python learning journey  
- Coursework and exercises from online programs (e.g. *Python for Everybody*, *Deep Learning for NLP*)  
- Occasional reflections or experiments that remind me why I started coding in the first place

### ☕️ Final Note

This repo is both my personal record and a small portfolio for professors or reviewers  
who might want to see how I learn, build, and (sometimes) break things on purpose.
