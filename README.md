# Learning-Portfolio
Hi! I'm Erika . This page records my progress in Data Science &amp; NLP.
# About This Project
# 🐍 Learning Python (Properly This Time)
Because apparently, writing a sketchy potion-bidding bot for *Neopets* years ago doesn’t count as “real experience.” 😅  

Back then, I built a small script that could automatically bid on  potions.
No formal training, no tutorials, just me figuring things out step by step for fun.  

Now, I’m back to learn Python, documenting my progress, keeping notes on what I’ve learned,  
and (hopefully) showing how far I’ve come since that first messy potion-sniping bot.

### 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- Notes and mini-projects from my ongoing Python learning journey  
- Coursework and exercises from online programs (e.g. *Python for Everybody*, *Deep Learning for NLP*)  
- Occasional reflections or experiments that remind me why I started coding in the first place

### ☕️ Final Note

This repo is both my personal record and a small portfolio for professors or reviewers  
who might want to see how I learn, build, and (sometimes) break things on purpose.
